# Path-Planning
## Aim:
To perform path planning simulation of a mobile robot. Create a  scenario, model a robot platform from a rigid body tree object, obtain a  binary occupancy grid map from the scenario and plan a path for the  mobile robot to follow using the _mobileRobotPRM_ path planning algorithm.

## Software Used:
MATLab R2022a (Robotics System Toolbox)
